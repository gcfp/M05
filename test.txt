Hello support from Google Cloud Platform
I have an application running on App Engine that needs to connect to a VM instance.
I don't want to use public IPs because of security and performance reasons.
Is there a way to connect my app with my virtual machine?

Answer:

Hello Customer,

Thank you for contacting Google Cloud Platform Support. My name is Guillem and I will be assisting you with this issue.

I understand that you want to connect your App Engine application with your VM instance without using public IPs. I will be happy to help you with this.

I have checked the documentation and I have found that you can use the Cloud VPN service to connect your App Engine application with your VM instance.

To be able to use this service, please follow this steps:

1. Please check this link [1] to have an overview of the Cloud VPN service and choose the best option for your use case.
2. Once you have chosen the best option for your use case, please follow this steps below:
    1. Create a Cloud VPN gateway in your VPC network.
    2. Create a Cloud VPN tunnel between your on-premises network and your VPC network.
    3. Create a Cloud Router in your VPC network.
3. Once you're done with the previous steps, you can connect your App Engine application with your VM instance by using the Cloud VPN service and the Cloud Router that you have created.

Here's some questions that you may have:

Q: How to create a VPC network?
A: You can create a VPC network[2] using the following command: gcloud compute networks create [NETWORK_NAME] --subnet-mode [SUBNET_MODE]

Q: How to create a Cloud VPN gateway on my VPC network?

Q: How to create a Cloud Router on my VPC network?
A: You can create a Cloud Router[5] in your VPC network using the following command: gcloud compute routers create [ROUTER_NAME] --network [NETWORK_NAME] --region [REGION]
