Hello Customer,

Thank you for contacting Google Cloud Platform Support. My name is Guillem and I will be assisting you with this request.

I understand that you would like to increase the quota for GPUS_ALL_REGIONS to 10 and you would like to know the cost of running the big GPUs for a model training during two months and then how much would it cost every year to run a 4 tesla T4.

To increase the quota, please follow the steps below or use this link:

1. Login to the GCP console
2. Click on the project name in the top left corner
3. Click on the project name again
4. Click on the "Quotas" tab
5. Click on the "Edit Quotas" button
6. Search for "GPUS_ALL_REGIONS"
7. Click on the "Edit Quotas" button
8. Change the quota to 10
9. Click on the "Save" button

Please note that the quota increase will take effect within 24 hours.
For additional information, please refer to the following link: https://cloud.google.com/compute/quotas#requesting_additional_quota

Using this mail information, I can estimate the cost to run a single Tesla P100 for two months will be arround 1.400â‚¬ per month.


To calculate the cost more precisely, please refer to the following link: https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator

I hope this information helps you. If you have any additional questions, please let me know. I will be happy to assist you.
